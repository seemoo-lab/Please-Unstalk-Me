# Please Unstalk Me: Understanding Stalking with Bluetooth Trackers and Democratizing Anti-Stalking Protection

## Contents 
This repository contains the research data used for the PETS Paper "Please Unstalk Me" by Alexander Heinrich, Leon WÃ¼rsching, and Matthias Hollick of SEEMOO, TU Darmstadt. 
We have one folder for the conducted *User Data Analysis* and one folder for our *Online Survey*. Both contain anonymized data and can be used for reproducing our research. 

## Usage 
Both folders contain Jupyter notebooks that can be used to reproduce plots that we show in our paper or calculate numbers that we state in the paper.
